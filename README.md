# 🚢 Titanic EDA – Credora Internship Task 02

This project is part of the **Data Science Internship** at **Credora**, focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

This notebook performs EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover key patterns related to passenger survival. The goal is to demonstrate foundational data science skills such as preprocessing, visualization, and insight extraction.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


---

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps

- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked` and dropped `Cabin`
- Converted categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) to numeric format
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `Name`, `Ticket`, and `PassengerId`
- Visualized survival patterns by gender, class, age, and fare
- Analyzed feature correlations using a heatmap

---

## 🔍 Summary of Insights

- **Females** had significantly higher survival rates than **males**
- **1st class** passengers were most likely to survive
- Younger passengers (especially **children**) had higher survival chances
- Passengers who paid a **higher fare** were more likely to survive

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open [EDA_Titanic.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14EHxREzIBlaoY8_XRs0Sg8Vs-PbGQzCL?usp=sharing) in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells to explore the analysis and visualizations
3. Review [Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf]("C:\Users\HP\Downloads\report task2 credora by Harshitha.pdf") for a clean summary of results
